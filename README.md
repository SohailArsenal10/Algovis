# Algovis
Algovis, a simple way of learning algorithms through visualizations.
We at Algovis beleive that every student, regardless of his learning capability can easily
grasp various things when they are visually taught.
We are presently working to create various visualizations.
Once we are successful, we are going to extend this learning platform even further 
by making a system that can visualize many possible programs under a language .
Thats all for now.!
