# Algovis
<br>
Algovis, a simple way of learning algorithms through visualizations.
I believe that every student, regardless of his learning capability can easily
grasp various things when they are visually taught.
I am presently working to create various visualizations.
Once I'm successful, then im are going to extend this learning platform even further 
by making a system that can visualize many possible programs under a language.<br>
That's all for now.!

We have developed Algorithm visualizations for below Algorithms currently: <br>
1. Linear search
2. Binary search
3. Bubble sort

You can download the code from Algovis git repository: https://github.com/karthikchiru12/Algovis <br>
Download the zip and extract it. <br>
Run the index.html and you are good to go without any other requirements.<br>
Feel free to experiment and change a line of code here and there and see what changes happen. <br>

You can see the visualizations we had developed at   https://karthikchiru12.github.io/Algovis/
