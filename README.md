# Algovis
Algovis, a simple way of learning algorithms through visualizations.
I beleive that every student, regardless of his learning capability can easily
grasp various things when they are visually taught.
I`am presently working to create various visualizations.
Once i`m are successful, then i`m are going to extend this learning platform even further 
by making a system that can visualize many possible programs under a language .
Thats all for now.!
