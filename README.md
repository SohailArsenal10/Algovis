# Algovis
Algovis, a simple way of learning algorithms through visualizations.
I beleive that every student, regardless of his learning capability can easily
grasp various things when they are visually taught.
Iam presently working to create various visualizations.
Once im successful, then im are going to extend this learning platform even further 
by making a system that can visualize many possible programs under a language .
Thats all for now.!
